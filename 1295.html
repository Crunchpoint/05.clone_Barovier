                    <p>In seven centuries of history, we have seen fashions come and go. Some were minimal, others more
                        baroque, but every one of them chased time in a desperate search for the “new.”<br> Time in
                        Venice, instead, goes by slowly. There is no rush, no craze, just a great deal of space and time
                        to develop your craft. So we took our time and in that time we have learned that we would rather
                        do something unique and enlightening that lasts forever instead of something new that
                        only fascinates you for one season. It takes strength to bring glass out from the fire and heat.
                        It takes patience to strive for nothing less than the perfect shape. And it takes heart, a lot
                        of it, to grow a legendary luxury lighting tradition into the new world, working with
                        innovators<br> and traditionalists alike. But again, we can afford the luxury of time.<br>
                        <br>And perhaps, so can you.

                    <h2>The Venetian Crystal</h2>
                    <p> The creations of Barovier&Toso are one-of-a-kind works in Venetian mouth blown crystal and
                        handcrafted by master artisans in Murano, custodians of an age-old tradition passed down across
                        the generations.<br> Angelo Barovier invented a revolutionary formula that made it possible to
                        obtain an unprecedented material with extraordinary characteristics of extreme transparency and
                        brightness.

                    <p> Thanks to a decree issued by the Republic of Venice in 1455, Angelo Barovier was granted the
                        exclusive right to produce “Cristallo Veneziano” (Venetian Crystal). The factor that makes this
                        formula unique, still used today through progressive refinements, is the total absence of lead
                        and arsenic. This is what makes our Venetian Crystal different from any other crystal on the
                        market, enabling the master artisans to carry out the entire production process in complete
                        safety, achieving exceptional results. The Venetian Crystal is a unique, sustainable and safe
                        material, ideal to give form to works of great artistic value: the creations of Barovier&Toso.

                    <h2>The Art of Crystal</h2>
                    <p>Our Venetian crystal takes a long time to make. It begins with the preparation of the partìa in
                        the afternoon, followed by firing throughout the night. On the next day, the master glassmaker
                        crafts the piece, after which the glass is cooled and finished on the third day. The cycle
                        constantly repeats, without interruptions.<br><br>
                        A dry mixture is prepared every afternoon, is known as the partìa, namely the cold blending of
                        sands and powders required for the production of the type of glass scheduled for making on the
                        following day in the furnace. </p>

                <div class="text-box02">
                    <p> Inside the glassworks all the operations are carried out by one or more operative teams that
                        work on the piece from the first removal, namely the extraction of the first glass piece for
                        crafting, all the way to the finished item (in terms of hot forming), which is then placed in an
                        annealing oven.<br>This operative unit is known in Murano as a piazza, formed by a variable
                        number of workers, depending on the rhythm of the work and the type of product to be
                        completed.<br>The piazza is guided by a master glassmaker who is assisted by a “servant”, his
                        main helper, as well as serventini and garzoni (apprentices).<br> The master glassmaker still
                        operates and works with antique tools, encoded by experience, simple and essential, which cannot
                        change over time: tubes, pliers, shears, compasses, templates and moulds.</p>

                        moulds. <br> The finished piece is still very hot, around 400°/500°, but it is already very
                        rigid and is moved to the cooling oven from which it will emerge completely de-tensioned, ready
                        for cold workmanship.<br> At this point the glass leaves the area strictly known as the
                        glassworks, and enters a more specific grinding department where very simple mechanical means
                        are used to detach, finish and polish the piece with saws and grinders.<br> Finally, the piece
                        passes through washing, quality control, preassembly, packing and shipping. </p>
